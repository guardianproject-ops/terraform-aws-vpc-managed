# Short description of this project
description: |-

  This is a terraform module that creates public and private subnets with
  optional nat instances or gateways, but it does not create the VPC. It is
  designed to be used with AWS Control Tower managed VPCs.

introduction: |-

  The VPC, nat-gateway, and nat-instance submodules are based off of
  Cloudposse's  [vpc](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc)  and
  [dynamic-subnets](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets)
  modules.

# How to use this project
usage: |-

  ```hcl
  module "vpc" {
    source = "git::https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-vpc-managed?ref=master"

    packer_subnet_cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/24"
    nat_subnet_cidr_block    = "10.0.1.0/24"
  }

  ```
